# Codehc's dotfiles

These are only tested on MacOS. They are built for the zsh shell and primarily for MacOS. There is a slight chance these will run on other OS' but I doubt it.

## Getting started

Clone this folder in your home directory and move into it.
`git clone https://github.com/Codehc/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles`

Make the install script executable.
`chmod +x install.sh`

Run the install script.
`./install.sh`
You should now be good to go.
